## What This Module Does
This module computes downstream population risk after Voronoi and population attachment are complete. It identifies non-served population, links those areas to river systems, propagates impact downstream, and aggregates the final at-risk results.

## How It Fits In
It runs after the population-enriched Voronoi stage. Its inputs come from the Voronoi outputs, WorldPOP rasters, watershed layers, and HydroRIVERS data, and its outputs feed the risk figures and reporting stages.

## Scripts in This Folder
| Script | Role | What it does | Key inputs | Key outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_rasters.sh` | shell launcher | Runs raster preparation in the configured execution mode | config values and positional overrides | raster-country stats and non-served intermediates |
| `create_rasters.py` | Python worker | Builds raster inputs for the non-served analysis | population-enriched Voronoi layers, rasters, basin data | served/non-served raster products |
| `find_unserved_pop.py` | Python worker | Thresholds and vectorizes non-served areas | raster products and threshold settings | non-served GeoPackages |
| `find_diff_pop.py` | Python worker | Computes population differences for later impact logic | served/unserved products and references | difference layers and tables |
| `assign_rivers_to_basin.py` | Python worker | Assigns river segments to basins | river and watershed layers | basin-linked river GeoPackage |
| `find_intersection_river.py` | Python worker | Links non-served polygons to nearby rivers | non-served polygons and basin-linked rivers | river-linked non-served polygons |
| `impact_polygons_pop.py` | Python worker | Propagates downstream impact and builds polygons | river-linked non-served features and propagation parameters | impact polygons and summaries |
| `find_pop_in_danger_pop.py` | Python worker | Aggregates final at-risk population results | impact polygons and population rasters | final at-risk parquet |
| `pop_differences_and_impact_polygons.sh` | shell launcher | Chains the middle risk stages | non-served outputs and config overrides | difference, river, and impact outputs |
| `find_pop_in_danger_pop.sh` | shell launcher | Runs the final aggregation stage | impact outputs and config defaults | final risk logs and outputs |

## Run Instructions
### Standard sequence
```bash
cd src
bash pop_at_risk_river_calculations/create_rasters.sh
bash pop_at_risk_river_calculations/pop_differences_and_impact_polygons.sh
bash pop_at_risk_river_calculations/find_pop_in_danger_pop.sh
```

### HPC
```bash
cd src
sbatch pop_at_risk_river_calculations/create_rasters.sh
sbatch pop_at_risk_river_calculations/find_pop_in_danger_pop.sh
```

A successful run writes files under `data/risk_calculation/...` and `data/results_pop_at_risk/...`, with logs under `logs/create_rasters.log`, `logs/pop_differences_and_impact_polygons.log`, and `logs/find_pop_in_danger_pop.log`.

## Smart Behaviors
- `create_rasters.sh` resolves `annotations.default_mode` from config and falls back to `array` or `sequential` depending on the wrapper logic.
- `create_rasters.py` skips countries that already have completed outputs.
- `assign_rivers_to_basin.py` skips assignment work if one of the join inputs is empty.
- `find_intersection_river.py` uses a hardcoded 5000 m search distance for matching non-served polygons to rivers.
- `impact_polygons_pop.py` uses propagation parameters from `impact_polygons_pop_params`, including `org_per_pop`, `c_limit`, `base_k`, `theta`, `step_m`, `least_discharge_cms`, and `impact_radii`.

## Known Issues / TODOs
- `find_intersection_river.py` currently hardcodes the river-search distance instead of exposing it as a config parameter.
- No explicit `TODO` or `FIXME` markers were found in this module.
