## Module Overview
`src/` is the executable heart of the project. Shell wrappers provide reproducible entry points and scheduler compatibility, while the Python modules hold the actual processing logic. Most scripts read `config.yaml` through `starter.py`, so the normal way to change paths or parameters is to edit config rather than code.

## Code Entry Files In This Package

| File | Role | When you use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.yaml` | Canonical workflow configuration | before any run |
| `starter.py` | Shared config resolver and positional override parser | when tracing how values are inherited |
| `pipelines.py` | Shared output-path and helper orchestration utilities | when tracing cross-stage path creation |

Shell launchers are execution wrappers, not starter dependencies. They are documented in the stage READMEs and in the root README canonical run order.

## Required Starter Data Files

These are the input data artifacts resolved from `config.yaml` that the repository depends on for end-to-end execution.

| Data file or directory | Why it is required | Default path status in this workspace |

| `../data/boundaries/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp` (+ sidecars) | country overlays for figure scripts | present |

Defaults for several annotation/segmentation paths are cluster-specific and must usually be overridden locally in `config.yaml`, especially:
- `merge_seg_results.paths.seg_results_filepath`
- `download_bing_annotate.paths.annotations_images_dir`
- `merge_annotations.paths.annotations_results_filepath`

## Configuration at a Glance
The full parameter tables now live in the relevant module READMEs. This file keeps the global, cross-stage settings that matter before you run anything.

| `find_unconnected_industrial_areas.mixed_use_category_keywords` | `['mix']` | Mixed-use token matching for industrial filtering |
| `download_and_vectorize.industrial_zenodo_url` | Zenodo URL | Industrial raster source |

Module-specific settings are documented in the corresponding README files under `src/`.

## Shared Override Convention

Most shell launchers accept the same positional override layout:

```bash
[level] [version] [buffer] [weight_method] [weight_func] [dynamic_buffering] [dynamic_buffer_k]
```

`starter.py` resolves these overrides after YAML inheritance. Earlier sections in `config.yaml` define shared values; later sections inherit them with `null`; explicit CLI values win over both.

## Core Root-Level Pipeline Scripts

Three of the most important production scripts sit directly under `src/` rather than inside a subpackage. They are documented here because they are central to the workflow and are often the first scripts a reader looks for.

| Script | Python module | What it does | Main inputs | Main outputs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `download_pop.sh` | `src.download_pop` | Downloads and prepares WorldPOP population inputs used later by `add_pop.py` and the risk workflow | `download_pop.paths.pop_dir` and shared config overrides | population rasters under `data/population` | Installs the package in editable mode, logs to `logs/pop_run.log`, and supports the shared positional override layout |
| `create_voronoi.sh` | `src.create_voronoi` | Runs the weighted Voronoi service-area stage across the configured approaches | canonical merged WWTP layer, watershed inputs, weighting settings, buffering settings | Voronoi GeoPackages under `create_voronoi.paths.voronoi_dir` and buffer outputs under `create_voronoi.paths.buffers_dir` | Supports `array`, `sequential`, and `parallel` execution modes via `create_voronoi.execution.mode` |
| `add_pop.sh` | `src.add_pop` | Intersects Voronoi outputs with population rasters and writes population-enriched service areas | one Voronoi file index, Voronoi outputs, population rasters | population-enriched GeoPackages under `add_pop.paths.pop_output_dir` | Runs either as a local single-index job or as a SLURM array task |

### `download_pop`
`download_pop.sh` is the population-ingest entry point. Run it after the source WWTP and watershed inputs are in place and before `add_pop.sh`. Its job is to build the population raster store consumed by later stages.

Workflow:
- Build WorldPop download URLs for all countries and years used by the project.
- Download archives or GeoTIFF files into the configured population directory.
- Extract compressed assets into per-country folders.
- If a country is delivered as CSV rather than TIFF, rasterize the point data to GeoTIFF.
- Mosaic multiple tiles into one country-level raster when needed.

Important outputs:
- `download_pop.paths.pop_dir/zipped`
- `download_pop.paths.pop_dir/unzipped`
- `download_pop.paths.pop_dir/rasterized`
- `download_pop.paths.pop_dir/merged`

Important behavior:
- The module uses `get_urls()` as the default URL source and keeps the HDX-based helper as a fallback path rather than the main workflow.
- CSV-based country inputs are projected to an estimated local UTM CRS for rasterization and then reprojected back to `EPSG:4326`.
- The shell wrapper reinstalls the package in editable mode before execution and writes a consolidated run log to `logs/pop_run.log`.

Key config:
- `download_pop.paths.pop_dir`

Typical run:
```bash
bash download_pop.sh
```

### `create_voronoi`
`create_voronoi.sh` is the central service-area launcher in the repository. It resolves `create_voronoi.execution.mode` from config and then executes one or more of the three supported approaches: WWTP-only Voronoi, watershed-aware Voronoi, and the city-based branch.

Approaches:
- `0`: WWTP Voronoi without watershed grouping.
- `1`: WWTP Voronoi with watershed-aware grouping and clipping.
- `2`: city-based Voronoi.

Workflow:
- Load the resolved configuration through `starter.py`.
- Build output paths from the current parameter combination.
- Select the requested approaches or default to all three.
- Skip completed approaches when outputs already exist and overwrite is disabled.
- Prepare grouped inputs, compute weights, generate weighted Voronoi regions, resolve overlaps, and clip results to the relevant basin or country boundary.

Execution modes:
- `sequential`: run all selected approaches one after another.
- `array`: run one approach per SLURM array task.
- `parallel`: run the approaches concurrently in the background.

Key controls:
- `create_voronoi.level`
- `create_voronoi.buffer`
- `create_voronoi.weight_method`
- `create_voronoi.weight_func`
- `create_voronoi.dynamic_buffering`
- `create_voronoi.dynamic_buffer_k`
- `create_voronoi.execution.mode`
- `create_voronoi.n_points`
- `create_voronoi.threshold`
- `create_voronoi.calculate_area_fn`
- `create_voronoi.calculate_buffer_fn`
- `create_voronoi.prepare_data_fn`

CLI details:
- Supports `--approach` to run only selected approaches.
- Supports `--only_round` to switch to the round-area weighting path.
- Supports `--verbose` for more detailed logging.

Typical runs:
```bash
bash create_voronoi.sh
python -m src.create_voronoi --approach 1 --verbose
python -m src.create_voronoi 8 2 15000 square_root mult true 0.75
```

### `add_pop`
`add_pop.sh` is the population-attachment bridge between geometric service areas and downstream analysis. It takes a Voronoi layer index, opens the configured rasters, and writes population-enriched service-area outputs to `add_pop.paths.pop_output_dir`.

Workflow:
- Select one Voronoi GeoPackage by zero-based index.
- Load the layer and read the country code column configured for the project.
- Resolve the available population rasters for each country represented in that file.
- Use `exactextract` to compute zonal statistics for every polygon.
- Add year-specific `*_zonal_sum` and `*_zonal_std` columns to the GeoPackage.
- Write the enriched result as `pop_added_<original_filename>.gpkg`.

Important behavior:
- The script expects the first positional argument to be the Voronoi file index; config overrides start after that index.
- It can run locally for a single index or in SLURM array mode via `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`.
- It processes all discovered raster years by default and restores the original CRS before writing outputs.
- When `pop_voronoi_overwrite` is false, existing output directories are preserved and the script warns that files may be skipped.

Key config:
- `add_pop.add_pop_max_workers`
- `add_pop.country_output_column`
- `add_pop.pop_voronoi_overwrite`
- `add_pop.paths.voronoi_dir`
- `add_pop.paths.pop_tif_dir`
- `add_pop.paths.pop_output_dir`

Typical runs:
```bash
bash add_pop.sh 0
sbatch add_pop.sh
```

These outputs are the direct inputs for validation, non-served population calculation, figure generation, and downstream risk propagation.
